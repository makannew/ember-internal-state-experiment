# ember-internal-state-experiment

This is an experiment with an html input tag which lives inside a child component and it gets its initial value from the parent component.
So in this experiment I tryed to setup in the way that parent state changes prioritised over child component changes. It means as usual input field contains changes made by user however input field will be updated by parent if parent state changed because it has priority over user changes.
