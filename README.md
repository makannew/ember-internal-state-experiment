# ember-internal-state-experiment

This is an experiment with an html input tag which lives inside a child component and it gets its initial value from the parent component.
So in this setup parent state overwrite changes made by child component. As usual input field contains changes made by user however input field will be updated by  parent state if parent state changed because it has priority over user changes.
